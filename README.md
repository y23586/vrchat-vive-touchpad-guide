## How to print this?
1. Press "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP" to download the models
2. Upload "vrchat-vive-touchpad-guide[-double].obj" to your favorite 3D printing services such as:
   * [DMM.make](https://www.shapeways.com/)
   * [shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/)
   * or, you can use your 3D printer if you have :)
3. Print it!
4. Attach the guides to your Vive controllers with rubber bands.

## Known issue
Since locomotion in VRChat is done by pressing the touchpad, too strong rubber band may cause unexpected locomotion.

## Disclaimer
Since VRChat is under development, the assignment of hand gestures to Vive touchpads **may** be changed,
and as a consequence, the guides will not work correctly.
